                        <p>Gourmet Ramen's mission is to give people the chance to taste the
                   traditional flavors of Japanese ramen originating from several regions
                   of Japan without the cost of a plane ticket. The founder of Gourmet
                   Ramen, Marissa Wood, trekked all over the country in search of the most unique, 
                   delicious flavors and came back with a reinforced knowledge and respect
                   for the art of the noodle bowl. From the snowy mountains of the Akita
                   Prefecture to the sunny shores of the Izu Peninsula, the greatest and
                   most ancient ramen techniques were studied and brought here to be shared
                   and appreciated.</p>

                <h2 class="section-header">Why Ramen?</h2>
                        <p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-26/instant-noodle-sales-top-100-billion-units-a-year/4653850">The instant version sales top 100 billion units a year.</a>
                    Almost no one can say that they've never tried it before. The accessibility,
                    speed of which it can be prepared, simplicity, and price are all sure reasons
                    why people would gravitate towards purchasing ramen. In fact, a survey done in
                    Japan by the Fuji Research Institute asked people what export they are most proud
                    of placed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1067506.stm">ramen at the top of the list.</a></p>
                    <p>Ramen is universally loved
                    and although it has a reputation as being popular for being cheap, people would
                    surely not buy so much of it if it was only because of necessity. Ramen is also
                    very delicious and most people have its preparation done in their own special
                    way with different ingredients down to a science, and many websites have offered
                    <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/6-ways-to-upgrade-instant-ramen/">recipes</a> for people to try new styles and techniques to prepare this
                    widely beloved dish.</p>
                    <p>Instant ramen, however, is a far cry from the delicacy that
                    can be found in authentic ramen from <a href="https://hokkaidoguide.com/ramen-alley/">the ramen alley of Hokkaido</a>
                    or even the not one but <a href="https://favy-jp.com/topics/1076">2 ramen alleys of Sapporo</a>, this is a dish
                    worth taking the extra steps to realize its true potential. The legendary flavors
                    of authentic Japanese ramen are now closer than ever, and are brought here to
                    be enjoyed to your heart's delight at Gourmet Ramen. We are just as excited
                    to share this fine cuisine as any would be excited to try it.</p>
